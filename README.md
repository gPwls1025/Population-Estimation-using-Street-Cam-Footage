# Population-Estimation-using-Street-Cam-Footage

This paper investigates the characteristics of urban environments using the StreetAware dataset. This dataset comprises synchronized high-resolution video recordings, exceeding 8 hours in total duration, captured from busy intersections in Brooklyn, NY. We aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of object co-occurrence patterns, human action dynamics, and traffic flow within these settings. Leveraging object detection models such as YOLO and RAM, we perform object identification and classification tasks. This allows us to analyze patterns of co-occurrence among objects and explore the relationships between these patterns. Additionally, Human Action Recognition (HAR) techniques are employed to investigate activity levels within the urban environment. The combined analysis of these factors sheds light on urban behavior and demographic variations across the captured locations. To effectively visualize our findings, we have designed a comprehensive dashboard. Key features of this dashboard include a network graph depicting object tag co-occurrence, visualizations of tag distribution across locations and demographics (gender), a bar chart representing the distribution of identified human actions, and a pie chart illustrating the co-occurrence of people and vehicles across the three captured locations. The versatility of this dashboard allows for its application in various domains, including urban planning, traffic management, public safety initiatives, and even commercial applications.
